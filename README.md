# PracticeProject
Project to practice development
This project will be a simple web app built from Node.js and React.

## Code/Work Management
Create two branches called `development` and `staging` as these will be our different environments.

Features should be done on branches under Jira/Trello cards and only merged into development/staging when thoroughly tested and ready.

Get a Jira/Trello board set up send invites.

There we can start to break down these Requirements into tasks and work on them incrementally.

## Requirements
### Phase 1
A web page that can take in two input fields and perform the following operations:
 - addition
 - subtraction 
 - multiplication
 - division

The page should be routed at `/calculate`.

Include a button that will send the two fields to the backend and perform the operation, returns the answer and prints it on the page.

The page design can be anything.

### Phase 2
Validate the inputs to make sure that the values are numbers.

Also add validation in the backend end point to ensure the numbers are correct, throw an error otherwise.

### Phase 3
Deploy to Heroku.

## Notes
Follow a guide like https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-create-a-react-app-with-a-node-backend-the-complete-guide/ to get the project started.

Preferably, this project should be managed via some sort of boarding medium, i.e. Trello or Jira. Send an invite to me once it's set up.

Don't hesitate to ask any questions!!
